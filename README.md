# Hi, I'm Eric! 🐈‍⬛

### 🌍 GIS Specialist | 🐧 Linux Veteran | 🏗️ Aspiring SysAdmin

My journey into tech started with a challenge: after graduating as a GIS & Geography major, I found myself locked out of the industry's standard tools due to the high cost of ArcGIS Pro and AutoCAD.

Refusing to be sidelined, I transitioned to the world of open-source. What began as a necessity—learning QGIS and LibreOffice—turned into a 5-year deep dive into the Linux ecosystem. Today, I'm a veteran Linux user dedicated to building open-source stacks that are as powerful as they are accessible.
